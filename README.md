# Movie Plaiter

This is an application written using the FLTK GUI toolkit that keeps track of a list of movies.

The movies are stored in a "plaited list", which is a linked list that can be traversed in three different orders (name, rating, or length). It does this by storing three different head nodes, and each node has three different links to the next node, depending on the sort order used.

This was one of my university projects during the spring of 2020. It was a solo project.
